# Theorizing...

## The big picture
* Replacing more of our minds with machines improves our individual well-being in the current political and economic system.

	* This is because slavery and other severe caste systems are viewed as unfair by the modern world.  
		* They still operate in the modern world but are typically relabelled.  
	* Making machines, with silicon brains slaves, is okay by the moral standards of most humans.

* More intellectual work done with simpler brain activity.
	* Why not harness people's twitchy, reactive, lizard brains with software to produce quality works of art, science, and culture?
	* Problems
		* The bar is always being raised by the disciplined and ambitious.

## RDF as a technology
* RDF triples:
	* Useful because they create connections.
		* Human minds are good at doing this.
		* Machines suck at it currently but are slowly getting better.
	* Poor as a specific record keeper.
		* No native support for lists.
			* aka ordering things is difficult.

## The purpose of databases
* archive or laboratory?
* database as record-keeping vs. database as foundation for new discovery.

## Big-Data and usability
The promise of "Big-Data" is more data means better understanding of relationships between all the things being collected, ranked, and measured. 

While true in theory, "Big-Data" systems that are hard to use cause frustration.
Understanding and frustration are mutually exclusive.

Detailed records need some abstraction, otherwise users are overwhelmed.

## Easiest way to think about it.
Filesystem served JSON as detailed record keeping.
SPARQL served triples are a system for searching exploring connections.

Filesystem served JSON is the court stenographer.
SPARQL served triples is the journalist covering the case.
