## Theorizing...

* Replacing more of our minds with machines improves our individual well-being in the current political and economic system, because slavery and other severe caste systems are viewed as unfair by the modern world.  They still operate in the modern world but are relabelled.

* More intellectual work can be done with simpler brain activity.
	* Why not harness people's twitchy, reactive, lizard brains with software to produce quality works of art, science, and culture?
	* The bar is always being raised.

* RDF triples:
	* Useful because they create connections.
		* Human minds are good at doing this.
		* Machines suck at it currently but are slowly getting better.
	* Poor as a specific record keeper.
		* No native support for lists.
		* aka ordering things is difficult.

Database user... meticulous record-keeper or cutting-edge theorist?
Different needs.

Database as record-keeping vs. Database as foundation for new discovery.

The promise of "Big-Data" is more data means better understanding of relationships between all the things being collected, ranked, and measured. 

While true in theory, Big-Data systems that are hard to use cause frustration.
Understanding and frustration are mutually exclusive.

Filesystem served JSON as specific records.
SPARQL served triples as system for searching exploring connections.


## Easiest way to think about it.
Filesystem served JSON is the court stenographer.
SPARQL served triples is the journalist.

## How this applies to JackSON.
Webservers are very good at serving small files.
