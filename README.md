# JackSON
JackSON is a lightweight API that will create, update, and retrieve JSON files RESTfully.
It's especially useful for prototyping Javascript web-applications, because it frees you from having to think about back-end storage and format-conversion for a while.
When used responsibly, client application data structures can be implemented, tested, and revised rapidly.
